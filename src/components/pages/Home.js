      Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Cognitive Science graduate from Carleton University in 2019 with a specialization in cognition and psychology and a minor in psychology.

I have a background in aviation with my glider and private pilot license. I recently started on a new endeavour: Swift Drone Academy Inc. We are a small business in the Ottawa area focused on providing focused and fully inclusive Drone training from start to finish. Check us out at SwiftDroneAcademy.ca.

I am currently working at QlikTech Inc as a project coordinator for a large scale IT transformation. Post project, I will return to my role as an Application Specialist, working with Salesforce development. In the past I have worked for NAV CANADA and NASA, done research in avaition and development in SharePoint and Power BI.
